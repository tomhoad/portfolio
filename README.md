# Tom Hoad Portfolio

The portfolio of Tom Hoad.

**Stack:**

- React (+ Hooks)
- Framer Motion
- CSS Modules
- Data is just driven by a JSON file. Maybe one day it'll be a CMS (Contentful?), but as it's just me, I don't mind writing into a JSON file

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)!

## Deployment

The site automatically builds to Netlify via the `main` branch.

PR environments are created when are a PR is opened.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
